# Encryption Algorithms

Looking forward to explore **Cyber Security**? Bringing to you **Encryption Algorithms** to lay some foundation about how things happen in CSec.

## What is Encryption ?
Encryption algorithms are used in cryptography to transfer information between two people such that the third person trying to steal information from you doesn't get the information.
To understand more about this refer to this video: [Encryption and it's types](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQDCe585Lnc)

Once, you have understood what it is, let's move on to How it's done. We'll study about **Asymmetric Encrytion** here. 


## RSA Algorithm
This is the most used algorithm for Asymmetric Encryption( public key encryption )
Go through [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXB-V_Keiu8) video,
it will take you from basics to the logic behind RSA algorithm.

By this video, you might have realised that the basic requirement to do this is to find two very big prime numbers. How will you do this?
Fermat's primality test comes to rescue for this. Watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUMotDWVLpw) video to know the logic behind this.


## AES ( Advanced Encryption Standard )
Refer to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnKPoWZnNNM) video, for an explanation and animation of AES Block Cipher Algorithm.



## An Example of **Symmetric Encrytion**: DES ( Data Encryption Standard )

- [Doing the calculations by hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sy0sXa73PZA&t=536s)

## DIVE DEEP
You have been delivered with sufficient logics required to code these algos. You can write your own codes via this.
If you are pretty unsure about DES and AES, [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGWpU4fHNAA&t=191s) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0quqUtrEWk8&t=8s) respectively will help you see the implementation for the same.


Great work in understanding the Algorithms! If you have any doubts in any of the algorithms feel free to discuss them on our [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/Go8oWRUqXsSufvCA75qMUQ).

We hope you liked this tutorial, as we have more coming up, next week on *Algorithms, Simplified*.
