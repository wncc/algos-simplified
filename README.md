# Algorithms Simplified

## By the Web & Coding Club IIT Bombay

Greetings from the Web & Coding Club!

WnCC proudly presents __Algorithms Simplified__. This is a series where we **do not require you to code**. You can just watch a 15 min video to learn something cool, that’s it!

Here's the list of topics covered till now:
- [Sorting Algorithms](./Sorting_Algorithm/README.md)
- [Mini-Max Algorithm](./MiniMax-Algorithm/README.md)
- [Shotest Path Algorithms (Basic)](./Shortest_Path_Algorithms_Basic/README.md)

Every Friday, short videos trivially explaining some mind-blowing yet intuitive algorithms will be shared, along with **optional**  tasks for those who want to code and implement those algorithms in a *Dive Deep* section as well.

Join our [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/Go8oWRUqXsSufvCA75qMUQ) for discussing your doubts.
